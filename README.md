# 🚖 OLA Data Analytics End-to-End Project

An end-to-end **Data Analytics** project built using **SQL Server, Excel, and Power BI** to analyse ride booking data from OLA. This project focuses on solving real-world business problems by transforming raw booking data into meaningful insights through SQL analysis and interactive dashboards.

The project demonstrates the complete analytics workflow—from data preparation and SQL querying to dashboard development and business insight generation.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

Ride-hailing platforms generate thousands of bookings every day. Understanding booking trends, customer behaviour, revenue, cancellations, and ratings is essential for improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

In this project, I analysed **120K ride bookings** using SQL Server and Power BI. Business questions were answered through SQL queries and reusable SQL Views, while Power BI dashboards were designed to visualise key performance indicators and operational metrics.

This project analyses a historical OLA ride-booking dataset covering 1 July 2026 to 31 July 2026. Using SQL Server, Excel, and Power BI, I explored booking trends, revenue, cancellations, customer behaviour, and vehicle performance to build an interactive analytics dashboard.
